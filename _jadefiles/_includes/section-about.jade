						p.text-muted.
							Hi, I'm Kyle and I'm currently seeking a new position as a JavaScript and/or Back-End Web Developer. I've been programming in one language or another 
							since I was 12 years old and recently left my career at Microsoft to pursue my true passion of developing software.
						p.text-muted.
							I've been going to Winthrop University taking some of the core programming classes required for a Web Developer degree in order to prepare for a new 
							career in this field. I'm currently most excited about JavaScript/jQuery, AngularJS, NodeJS, and the LAMP stack.
